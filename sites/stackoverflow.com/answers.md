###[A] Garbage (non-intelligible gibberish or troll meaningless content)
This is a garbage post by a 1-rep unregistered user without any meaningful contributions. [Flag as "Rude or abusive"](//meta.stackexchange.com/a/58035) to destroy it quickly without poorly seeding the spam detector.

###[A] Code only answer
Thank you for this code snippet, which might provide some limited, immediate help. A [proper explanation would greatly improve its long-term value](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/114762) by showing _why_ this is a good solution to the problem, and would make it more useful to future readers with other, similar questions. Please [edit] your answer to add some explanation, including the assumptions you've made.

###[A] Question as answer
This post isn't an actual attempt at answering the question. Please note [$SITENAME$ doesn't work like a discussion forum](//$SITEURL$/about), it is a Q&A site where every post is either a question or an answer to a question. Posts can also have [comments](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment) - small sentences like this one - that can be used to critique or request clarification from an author. This should be either a comment or a [new question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask).

###[A] Me too!
Please don't add *"Me too"* as answers. It doesn't actually provide an answer to the question. If you have a different but related question, then [ask](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) it (reference this one if it will help provide context). If you're interested in this specific question, you can [upvote](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/vote-up) it, leave a [comment](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment), or start a [bounty](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/set-bounties) once you have enough [reputation](//$SITEURL$/help/whats-reputation).

###[A] Thanks!
Please don't add _"thanks"_ as answers. They don't actually provide an answer to the question, and can be perceived as noise by its future visitors. Once you [earn](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/146472) enough [reputation](//$SITEURL$/help/whats-reputation), you will gain privileges to [upvote answers](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/vote-up) you like. This way future visitors of the question will see a higher vote count on that answer, and the answerer will also be rewarded with reputation points. See [Why is voting important](//$SITEURL$/help/why-vote).

###[A] Begging for answer
Posting follow-up requests as answers is not effective at attracting answerers. Read [What should I do if no one answers my question?](//stackoverflow.com/help/no-one-answers) for suggestions to get more attention.

###[A] Comment as answer
This does not provide an answer to the question. To critique or request clarification from an author, leave a comment below their post. If you [earn](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/146472) sufficient [reputation](//$SITEURL$/help/whats-reputation) you will be able to [comment on any post](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment).

###[A] Many formatting issues
Please take a moment to read through the [editing help](//$SITEURL$/editing-help) in the [help]. Formatting on $SITENAME$ is different than other sites.

###[A] Same answer posted to multiple questions
Please don't add the same answer to multiple questions. Answer the best one and flag the rest as duplicates. See [Is it acceptable to add a duplicate answer to several questions?](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/104227)

###[A] Duplicate link only
Please don't post link-only answers to other $SITENAME$ questions. Instead, vote/flag to close as duplicate, or, if the question is not a duplicate, *tailor the answer to this specific question.*

###[A] Link only to other SE
Please don't post link-only answers to other Stack Exchange questions. Instead, include the essential portions of the answer here, and *tailor the answer to this specific question.*

###[A] Link only answer
While this link might provide some limited, immediate help, an answer [should include sufficient context around the link](//meta.stackoverflow.com/a/8259) so your fellow users will have some idea what it is and why itâ€™s there. Always quote the most relevant part of an important link, to make it more useful to future readers with other, similar questions. In addition, other users tend to respond negatively to answers which are [barely more than a link to an external site](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/225370), and they [might be deleted](//$SITEURL$/help/deleted-answers).

###[A] Answering off-topic / bad question
Please don't post answers on obviously off topic / bad questions! [See: **Should one advise on off topic questions?**](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/276572)

###[A] Tool recommendation for a tool request
Thank you for participating on Stack Overflow. However please note that the question you have answered is off-topic as per the [help/on-topic] since it is a tool request. Answers to such questions tend to be of [poor quality](//meta.stackexchange.com/a/8259) and quickly become stale (what might have been a good resource two years ago may simply not exist anymore). You can flag this question as off-topic by clicking the "flag" link once you have sufficient reputation.

###[A] Pointing out a typo
Please don't post answers only pointing out a typographical issue or a missing character. Such answers are unlikely to help future visitors since they are specific to OP's code. Instead, flag or vote to close the question as off-topic as per the [help/on-topic].

###[A] Code as image
[Please don't post your code as an image](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/285551).

###[A] Code improperly edited by non-OP user (Restore code first)
@code-editor Edits to others' code may invalidate questions and answers. Please read [When should I make edits to code?](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/260245)

###[A] Identical answers
Please don't post identical answers to multiple questions. Post one good answer, then vote/flag to close the other questions as duplicates. If the question is not a duplicate, *tailor your answers to the question.*

###[A] OP using an answer for further information
Please use the *Post answer* button only for actual answers. You should [edit] your original question to add additional information.

###[A] OP adding a new question as an answer
If you have another question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) button.

###[A] Non English answer
Please write your answer in English, since [$SITENAME$ is an English site.](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/13676)

###[A] Self Promotion
Just linking to your own library or tutorial is not a good answer. Linking to it, explaining why it solves the problem, providing code on how to do so and disclaiming that you wrote it makes for a better answer. See: [**What signifies "Good" self promotion?**](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/182212)

###[A] Language, please
I know you're excited, but please try to keep your language under control. Think of $SITENAME$ as more like Wikipedia than like Reddit.

###[A] Borderline Link-Only answer
This is a borderline [link-only answer](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/8231). You should expand your answer to include as much information here, and use the link only for reference.

###[A] Borderline-spam link answer
Please be careful with linking to your own content on different sites, you don't want to be a [spammer](//$SITEURL$/help/promotion). You should be including the majority of the content here, and use the link only as a reference.

###[A] Spam
Excessive promotion of a specific product/resource may be perceived by the community as **spam**. Take a look at the [help], especially [What kind of behavior is expected of users?](//$SITEURL$/help/behavior)'s last section: _Avoid overt self-promotion_. You might also be interested in [How do I advertise on $SITENAME$?](//$SITEURL$/help/advertising).

###[A] Offer only 1:1 help
While helping individuals, we also try to produce a permanent source of future help for others - so answers that produce a tangible record are preferred. Before offering 1:1 help, read [this Meta post](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/280603) and reconsider making the effort to document the answer.
