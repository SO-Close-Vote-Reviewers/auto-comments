###[A] Spam
Excessive promotion of a specific product/resource may be perceived by the community as **spam**. Take a look at the [help], specially [What kind of behavior is expected of users?](//$SITEURL$/help/behavior)'s last section: _Avoid overt self-promotion_. You might also be interested in [How to not be a spammer](//$SITEURL$/help/promotion) and [How do I advertise on $SITENAME$?](http://$SITEURL$/help/advertising).

###[A] Garbage (non-intelligible gibberish or troll meaningless content)
This is a garbage post by an 1-rep unregistered user without any meaningful contributions. [Flag as "Rude or abusive"](//meta.stackexchange.com/a/58035) to destroy it quickly without poorly seeding the spam detector.

###[A] Code only answer
While this code may solve the question, [including an explanation](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/114762) of how and why this solves the problem would really help to improve the quality of your post, and probably result in more up-votes. Remember that you are answering the question for readers in the future, not just the person asking now. Please [edit] your answer to add explanations and give an indication of what limitations and assumptions apply.

###[A] Me too!
Please don't add _Me too!_ as answers. It doesn't actually provide an answer to the question and can be perceived as noise by its future visitors. If you have a different but related question then [ask](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) it (reference this one if it will help provide context). If you're interested in this specific question, you can [upvote](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/vote-up) it or leave a [comment](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment) once you have enough [reputation](//$SITEURL$/help/whats-reputation).

###[A] Answers just to say Thanks!
Please don't add _"thanks"_ as answers. They don't actually provide an answer to the question, and can be perceived as noise by its future visitors. Once you [earn](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/146472) enough [reputation](//$SITEURL$/help/whats-reputation), you will gain privileges to [upvote answers](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/vote-up) you like. This way future visitors of the question will see a higher vote count on that answer, and the answerer will also be rewarded with reputation points. See [Why is voting important](//$SITEURL$/help/why-vote).

###[A] Begging for answer
Posting follow-up requests as answers is not effective at attracting answerers. Read [What should I do if no one answers my question?](//stackoverflow.com/help/no-one-answers) for suggestions to get more attention.

###[A] NAAs by < 50 rep
This does not provide an answer to the question. You can [search for similar questions](//$SITEURL$/search), or refer to the related and linked questions on the right-hand side of the page to find an answer. If you have a related but different question, [ask a new question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask), and include a link to this one to help provide context. See: [Ask questions, get answers, no distractions](//$SITEURL$/tour)

###[A] NAAs by > 50 rep
This post doesn't look like an attempt to answer this question. Every post here is expected to be an explicit attempt to *answer* this question; if you have a critique or need a clarification of the question or another answer, you can [post a comment](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment) (like this one) directly below it. Please remove this answer and create either a comment or a new question. See: [Ask questions, get answers, no distractions](//$SITEURL$/tour).

###[A] Question posted as an answer
This post isn't an actual attempt at answering the question. Please note [$SITENAME$ doesn't work like a discussion forum](//$SITEURL$/about), it is a Q&A site where every post is either a question or an answer to a question. Posts can also have [comments](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment) — small sentences like this one — that can be used to critique or request clarification from an author. This should be either a comment or a [new question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask).

###[A] Many formatting issues (VLQ)
Please take a moment to read through the [editing help](//$SITEURL$/editing-help) in the [help]. Formatting on $SITENAME$ is different than other sites.

###[A] Same answer posted to multiple questions
Please don't add the same answer to multiple questions. Answer the best one and flag the rest as duplicates. See [Is it acceptable to add a duplicate answer to several questions?](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/104227)

###[A] Link only (SO link)
This should be a comment, not an answer. If it is a duplicate question, [vote to close](//stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/close-questions) as such and/or leave a comment once you [earn](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/146472) enough [reputation](//stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation). If not, *tailor the answer to this specific question*.

###[A] Link only (SE link)
Please don't post link-only answers to other Stack Exchange questions. Instead, include the essential portions of the answer here, and *tailor the answer to this specific question.*

###[A] Link only
A link to a solution is welcome, but please ensure your answer is useful without it: [add context around the link](//meta.stackexchange.com/a/8259) so your fellow users will have some idea what it is and why it’s there, then quote the most relevant part of the page you're linking to in case the target page is unavailable. [Answers that are little more than a link may be deleted](//$SITEURL$/help/deleted-answers).

###[A] Answering off-topic/bad question
Please don't post answers on obviously off topic/bad questions! [See: **Should one advise on off topic questions?**](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/276572)

###[A] Tool recommendation for a tool request
Thank you for participating on Stack Overflow. However please note that the question you have answered is off-topic as per the [help/on-topic] since it is a tool request. Answers to such questions tend to be of [poor quality](//meta.stackexchange.com/a/8259) and quickly become stale (what might have been a good resource two years ago may simply not exist anymore). You can flag this question as off-topic by clicking the "flag" link once you have sufficient reputation.

###[A] Pointing out a typo
Please don't post answers only pointing out a typographical issue or a missing character. Such answers are unlikely to help future visitors since they are specific to OP's code. Instead, flag or vote to close the question as off-topic as per the [help/on-topic].

###[A] Data as image
Please add code and data as text ([using code formatting](//stackoverflow.com/editing-help#code)), not images. Images: A) don't allow us to copy-&-paste the code/errors/data for testing; B) don't permit searching based on the code/error/data contents; and [many more reasons](//meta.stackoverflow.com/a/285557). In general, code/errors/data in text format >>>> code/errors/data as an image >> nothing. Images should only be used, in addition to text in code format, if having the image adds something significant that is not conveyed by just the text code/error/data.

###[A] Code improperly edited by non-OP user (Restore code first)
Edits to other people's code may invalidate questions and answers. Please read [When should I make edits to code?](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/260245)

###[A] Non English answer
Please write your answer in English, as [$SITENAME$ is an English site.](//meta.stackexchange.com/q/13676)

###[A] Language, please
I know you're excited, but please try to keep your language under control. Think of Stack Overflow as more like Wikipedia than like Reddit.

###[A] Borderline-spam link answer
Please be careful with linking to your own content on different sites, you don't want to be a [spammer](//$SITEURL$/help/promotion). You should be including the majority of the content here, and use the link only as a reference.

###[A] Vandalize your post
Please don't make more work for other people by vandalizing your posts. By posting on the Stack Exchange network, you've granted a non-revocable right, under the [CC BY-SA 3.0 license](//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), for Stack Exchange to distribute that content (i.e. regardless of your future choices).

###[A] Profanity
[Be Nice](//$SITEURL$/help/be-nice). Do not use profanity gratuitously on the site.

###[A] Offer only 1:1 help
While helping individuals, we also try to produce a permanent source of future help for others - so answers that produce a tangible record are preferred. Before offering 1:1 help, read [this Meta post](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/280603) and reconsider making the effort to document the answer.
